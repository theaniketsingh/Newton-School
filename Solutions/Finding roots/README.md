### Problem Statement
- Write a program to find roots of a quadratic equation using switch case.

### Input :
- The first line of the input contains the three float values a, b, and c of equation ax^2 + bx + c.

### Constraints :
- 1<= a, b, c <= 50

### Output :
- Print the two roots in two different lines and for imaginary roots print real and imaginary part of one root with (+/- and i )sign in between in one line and other in next line.

### Note :
- Imaginary roots can also be there and roots are considered upto 2 decimal places.

### Example
```
Sample Input 1 :
4 -2 -10

Sample Output 2 :
1.85
-1.35

Sample Input 2 :
2 1 10

Sample Output 2:
-0.25 + i2.22
-0.25 - i2.22
