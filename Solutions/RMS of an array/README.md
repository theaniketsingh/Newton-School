### Problem Statement
- Given an array A of size N. You need to find the root mean square (RMS) of the array i. e you first need to square all values of array and take its mean.
- Then you need to return the square root of mean. Print the answer with precision upto 6 decimal places.

### Input :
- First line contains an integer N - the size of array
- Next line contains N space separated integers - the elements of array.

### Constraints :
- 1 <= N <= 100
- 1 <= Ai <= 100

### Output :
- Print the RMS value of the array.

### Example
```
Sample Input 1:
4
1 2 3 4

Output:
2.738613

Explanation:
Sum of squares = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30
Mean = 30 / 4 = 7.5
Taking square root of 7.5 gives 2.738613

Sample Input 2:
2
7 13

Output:
10.440307

Explanation:
Sum of squares = 49 + 169 = 218
Mean = 218 / 2 = 109
Taking square root of 109 gives 10.440307
